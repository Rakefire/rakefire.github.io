              Try us for a month. There is no fixed term, unless you want to pay for an annual plan, so you can cancel at any time. If you aren't completely satisfied, we'll refund your money and call it a day.
                <div class="question">
                  <b>When you say "bug fixes or minor enhancements tasks are included", what do you mean?</b>
                  This would include any development or operations tasks that takes an hour or so to complete. This would include a database inconsistency, replacing an SSL certificate,
                  or fixing a small DNS issue. We know a big job when we see one and will let you know. In general, we're pretty flexible.
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                  <b>Will you fix any crash/bug that happens?</b>
                  Yep, or at least do our best to try depending on the complexity of the issue!
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                  <b>If I cancel, are the accounts and data you've collected transferrable to me?</b>
                  They sure are! If you decide to move on, we will arrange to have all the accounts transferred to you. This will obviously involve you taking on the billing for the various
                  accounts. If you choose to not continue with the accounts we will, to the best of our ability (and if the services support it), export your data and provide it to you.
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                  <b>Will you sign my NDA?</b>
                  Maybe, we actually have good Mutual Non-Disclosure we can use. Just ask!
                </div>

                <div class="question">
                  <b>This seems a little expensive, isn't it?</b>
                  Building and maintaining web applications are expensive, but they are critical to your business. If you rely on a custom web application to drive your business, interact with your customers, and build your brand, you can't afford downtime. You can't afford to lose your customers data. You cannot afford lost sales caused by bugs. Maintaining a web application requires specialized knowledge of Ruby on Rails, Heroku, database services, caching, gem versioning, and quick thinking that will keep your application running and optimized while you sleep.<br/><br/>
                  Compare the cost of hiring a full-time employee, benefits, software, hardware, training, time spent learning your app, etc. If our monthly plans don't work for you, we can assist you in your hiring of such a person.
