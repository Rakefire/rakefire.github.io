              Try us for a month. There is no fixed term, unless you want to pay for an annual plan, so you can cancel at any time. If you aren't completely satisfied, we'll refund your money and call it a day.
              <br/><br/>
            <b>When you say "bug fixes or minor enhancements tasks are included", what do you mean?</b> This would include any development or operations tasks that takes an hour or so to complete. This would include a database inconsistency, replacing an SSL certificate, or fixing a small DNS issue. We know a big job when we see one and will let you know. In general, we're pretty flexible.
<br/><br/>

            <b>Will you fix any crash/bug that happens?</b> Yep, or at least do our best to try depending on the complexity of the issue!
<br/><br/>
            <b>If I cancel, are the accounts and data you've collected transferrable to me?</b> They sure are! If you decide to move on, we will arrange to have all the accounts transferred to you. This will obviously involve you taking on the billing for the various accounts. If you choose to not continue with the accounts we will, to the best of our ability (and if the services support it), export your data and provide it to you.
<br/><br/>
            <b>Will you sign my NDA?</b> Maybe, we actually have good Mutual Non-Disclosure we can use. Just ask!
